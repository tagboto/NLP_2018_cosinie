a stunning movie   ', 'raw and sublimely moving   ', 'it felt like a very gripping  intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage

performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering   ', 'emily watsons character is very strong  and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything   ', 'despite the pans of reviewers  i liked this movie   ', 'in fact  i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt   ', 'aailiyah was pretty good as akasha  in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene   ', 'im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style  sensitivities and treatments   ', 'i guess i liked the

lovely film   ', 'this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub genre   ', 'this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s   ', 'a standout scene   ', 'technically  the film is well made with impressive camera work  solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill   ', 'its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema   ', 'the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end   ', 'i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son   ', 'this movie is also revealing   ', 'personally  i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue   ', 'ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up   ', 'its a fresh  subtle  and rather sublime effect   ', 'an italian reviewer called this \"a small  great film \" and thats right   ', 'all the actors give a wonderful performance  especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris  who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star   ', 'you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie  and a lot about the movie business itself   ', 'the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the \"acting coach\" are fascinating   ', 'also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard   ', 'you wont forget this movie  ', 'i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973  when it was \"the stranger\" and i loved it   ', 'but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in

in contrast to its austere backdrop   ', 'you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars   ', 'the acting  as youd expect from this cast  is top notch   ', 'the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well  particularly grimes and blake  and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic   ', 'angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing  violin playing anatomist doctor quinn   ', 'conclusion   i loved it   ', 'its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie   ', 'i struggle to find anything bad to say about it   ', 'mark my words  this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20  30  40 years down the line   ', 'its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949  as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time   ', 'the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand  for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism   ', 'plus  with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time  it does an amazing job  ', 'juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south   ', 'trumbull on i love lucy   ', 'see it with your kids if you have a chance  it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years   ', 'see both films if you can   ', 'it was that year  however  that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella \"the dead   ', 'feelings  thoughts   gabriels discomfort during the dance   all these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal   ', 'this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever   ', 'it has everything you could want    suspense  drama  comedy  confusing subplots  native americans  brain eating    if youre looking for the be all  end all of brainsucking movies  look no further   ', '\" with great sound effects  and impressive special effects  i cant recommend this movie enough   ', 'call me a nut  but i think this is one of the best movies ever   ', 'great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle   ', 'i wont spoil it  but the ending in pretty amazing   ', 'the best scene in the movie is at the end  but i wont spoil it   ', 'if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity  then this is it  ', 'the result is a powerhouse achievement  made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity  and its distorted interpretations of fame   ', 'a film not easily forgotten   ', 'but  kevin spacey is an excellent  verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman â– and totally believable because he is a great actor   ', 'the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years   ', 'the characters are interesting  even if a bit predictable   ', 'highly recommended for all ages  although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references  they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  ', 'great movie  ', 'linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film   ', 'shes poised and amazing   ', 'the fact is  this film is a wonderful  heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams   ', 'the best part about \"nurse betty\" is its unpredictability   ', 'director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality  and along with the touching drama  and hilarious comedy  you can never tell what is going to happen next   ', 'there is  however  some pretty good acting at least  for this type of film   ', 'i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it   ', 'i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes   ', 'excellent short film   ', 'hopefully  the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast  or win us over with a whole new film   ', 'not much dialogue  not much music  the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture   ', 'funny  clever  hip   just like prays previous film  hype  ', 'it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen   ', 'paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years   ', 'the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie   ', 'i rate this movie 9 10   ', 'i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut  but the pacing  the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye   ', 'the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie   ', 'kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in \"at play in the fields of the lord\"   ', 'for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience   ', 'it never condescends  all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems   ', 'the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen   ', 'they are so easy to love  but even more easy to identify with   ', 'this movie is great  especially if you enjoy visual arts   ', 'the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful   ', 'the story is also both funny and poignant at times   ', 'people who like european films and \"art movies\" will like this movie   ', 'this is truly an art movie  it actually has a lot of art in it   ', 'go rent it   ', 'however  after finally watching this film  i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts  i also found myself watching it over and over again   ', 'its the one movie that never ceases to interest me  simply because it keeps me alert  as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings   ', 'brilliance indeed   ', 'but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet  their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking  mindblowing experience this film will give you   ', 'think of the film being like a dream   ', 'simply beautiful   ', 'both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who   maybe   has written a subversive tract   ', 'its a gloriously fun  fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver   ', 'it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives   ', 'but it picked up speed and got right to the point   ', 'it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the \"gadget\"   ', 'i enjoyed it   ', 'i have recommended it to friends   ', 'i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz   ', 'both actors truly understand and become their particular character  delivering a convincing  sincere performance   ', 'their on screen chemistry  critical to the entire film  is genuine   ', 'the films dialogue is natural  real to life   ', 'the writer  gorman bechard  undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and character age appropriate   ', 'the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film   ', 'each track commands sentiment  actually contributing to the scenes and characters   ', 'definitely worth seeingâ… its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness   ', 'hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili  \"gake no ue no ponyo\" ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood   ', 'at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disney pixars cgi masterpieces  it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional hand drawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories   ', 'enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film   ', 'the art style has the appearance of crayon pencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful   ', 'still  it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost   ', 'just consider the excellent story  solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses   ', 'then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th  2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the
